# Assessment2
Write a C# application that solves the following problem:  * Return the fifth element __from the end__ of a singly linked list of integers.  Do not iterate the list more than once. Assume the list size cannot be known  without traversing the list.  * Support your application with unit tests.  * Solve the same problem above, but assume the linked list contains strings  instead of integers.
